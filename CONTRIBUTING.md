# Contributing Guidelines

We believe that Deno's built-in
[formatter](https://deno.land/manual/tools/formatter) and
[linter](https://deno.land/manual/tools/linter) should be our standard. We may
also request for style-related change if the linter or formatter does not catch
them.

We recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and
[Deno's Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno).
